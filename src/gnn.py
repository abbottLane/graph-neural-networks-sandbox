# This code creates a GNN in PyTorch, which has two linear layers: an input-to-hidden layer and a hidden-to-output layer. The input-to-hidden layer maps the input node features to a hidden representation, and the hidden-to-output layer maps the hidden representation to the output node labels.

# The GNN also includes a propagation step, where the information and features of the nodes in the graph are propagated between the nodes in the graph for a specified number of steps. This allows the GNN to capture the relationships between the nodes in the graph and use this information to make predictions.

# To apply the GNN to input data, you can pass a batch of node features and adjacency matrices as input to the forward() method of the GNN. This will apply the GNN to the input data and return the predicted node labels. You can then use a loss function, such as cross-entropy loss, to measure the difference between the predicted labels and the true labels, and use an optimization algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent, to adjust the weights of the GNN based on the loss.

# Overall, this is a simple example of how you can build a GNN in PyTorch, which can be used for various graph-based tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and recommendation.
